# CapMan
A Pac Man Inspired Game for Learning and Fun!


# Ideas

Fruits are hats that change the game (kinda like power ups / power downs).
Bowler's Hat (Odd Job) is a weapon you can use to kill Enemies
Hat Overflow: All enemies blow up
Dunce Cap: Power Down


What should Dots / Power Pills be?
What should Enemies be?
