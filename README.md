# CapMan
A Pac Man Inspired Game for Learning and Fun!


# Ideas

Fruits are hats that change the game (kinda like power ups / power downs).
Bowler's Hat (Odd Job) is a weapon you can use to kill Enemies
Hat Overflow: All enemies blow up
Dunce Cap: Power Down


What should Dots / Power Pills be?
What should Enemies be?

# TODO: "Fix" Cap Man to flip rather than rotate

# Known Bugs

When the Player is moving, if the distance moved is > 1, it is possible to move
through walls. A potential solution is to do a full ray cast for the whole
distance rather than assuming the distance < 1.
